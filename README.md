# Grid

This is a game similar to generals.io, but you are alone, so you can peacefully farm cells & conquer the whole board..

Some differences:

 * There are no cities.
 * Inactive cells start with a value of -1 and periodically decrease, making these more difficult to conquer.


Ideas:
 - Virus: you have to eat the virus before the virus eats you.
   The virus would just spread to neighbors slowly.
 - Automations: cell direction represented by arrows indicating the flow.
   each cell moves value according to its flow at every step.
